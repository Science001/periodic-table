# periodic-table
A simple periodic table project made for my college's Carnival of Science.

This was my very first project and acted as my stepping stone into backend development and AJAX requests. The Main Periodic Table UI was taken from a [CodePen by Alma Madsen](https://codepen.io/nemophrost/pen/EkImb). The tabular details UI was made by me.

My main focus over this project was to try the NodeJS w/ ExpressJS backend development and on how to link the frontend with the backend using AJAX requests. This gave me exposure to npm modules, routing and dynamic UI updation.

The UI is very basic and not standard, mainly because I wasn't into UI designing at that point of time. My design skills have significantly improved since then, which can be seen in my another [hobby project](https://github.com/Science001/to-do) that focuses more on clean UI and cool UX.
